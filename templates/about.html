  <h2>Hey everyone</h2>
  <h3>My name is shahid and Iâ€™m a complete Python nut</h3>

  <p>
  Iâ€™ve been obsessed with programming ever since I managed to convince my parents to buy me a dusty
  old Commodore 64 from the classifieds in a local newspaper. And my love for writing code hasnâ€™t diminished
  since then.
  </p>

  <p>
  Eventually I got a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information and Communication Engineering.
  I worked in full-time positions for a few years and today Iâ€™m an independent software developer and consultant.
  </p>

  <p>
  I was born and grew up in Germany but then later moved to Canada.
  I love both countriesâ€”and fortunately I mostly work remotely these days so I get to visit each one a fair bit.
  Iâ€™m glad I found a partner whoâ€™s willing to put up with these antics ðŸ™‚
  </p>

  <p>
  In terms of non-computer hobbies I like working out at the gym, cooking vegetarian food
  (buying my first proper cast-iron wok in Vancouverâ€™s chinatown changed my life, haha),
  and going on hikes. I also read a lot. In general I found what makes me the happiest is building stuff.
  So I try and optimize for that. Every now and then I play some guitar to relax.
